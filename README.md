# intellichoice-quiz-engine

# The purpose of this web application is to provide a quiz and practice engine to supplement the math tutoring provided by IntelliChoice. The application will feature a minimalist design with a simplistic user interface.

# Our hope is that this project can create the framework for a powerful online tool to supplement the in-person tutoring provided by IntelliChoice. It can also serve as a means for IntelliChoice to better understand their students and the students' progress.

# To run the API: enter terminal and navigate to the API folder and run "gulp".
# Then navigate to the main IntelliVision folder and run "docker-compose up"
